        <h7>In Hollywood, actor James Franco is throwing a party with a slew of celebrity pals. Among those in
            attendance are his buddies Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson. 
            Suddenly, an apocalypse of biblical proportions erupts, causing untold carnage among Tinseltown's elite 
            and trapping Franco's party in his home. As the world they knew disintegrates outside, cabin fever and 
            dwindling supplies threaten to tear the six friends apart.

        <h1>The Interview</h1>
        
        <br>
    
        <h7>Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) 
            are the team behind the popular tabloid-TV show "Skylark Tonight." After 
            learning that North Korea's Kim Jong Un (Randall Park) is a huge fan of the show, 
            they successfully set up an interview with him, hoping to legitimize themselves as 
            actual journalists. However, as Dave and Aaron prepare for their journey to Pyongyang, 
            the CIA steps in, recruits them, and assigns them an incredible mission: Assassinate 
            the dictator.

        <h1>The Dictator</h1>
        
        <br> 
    
        <h7>Gen. Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) has ruled the oil-rich North African country 
            of Wadiya since the age of six, when 97 stray bullets and a hand grenade killed 
            his father in a hunting accident. After an assassination attempt takes the life 
            of yet another body-double, Tamir (Ben Kingsley), Aladeen's uncle and most trusted 
            adviser, convinces Aladeen to go to New York. Unfortunately, Aladeen has a less-than
            -friendly reception from exiled Wadiyans, who want their country freed from his despotic 
            rule.

        <h7>When cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) join the secret Jump Street

            teenage terror and anxiety they thought they had left behind.
