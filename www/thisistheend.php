        <h1>The Interview</h1>
        
        <br>
    
        <h7>Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) 
            are the team behind the popular tabloid-TV show "Skylark Tonight." After 
            learning that North Korea's Kim Jong Un (Randall Park) is a huge fan of the show, 
            they successfully set up an interview with him, hoping to legitimize themselves as 
            actual journalists. However, as Dave and Aaron prepare for their journey to Pyongyang, 
            the CIA steps in, recruits them, and assigns them an incredible mission: Assassinate 
            the dictator.

        <h1>21 Jump Street</h1>
        
        <br>
    
        <h7>When cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) join the secret Jump Street 
            unit, they use their youthful appearances to go under cover as high-school students. 
            They trade in their guns and badges for backpacks, and set out to shut down a dangerous 
            drug ring. But, as time goes on, Schmidt and Jenko discover that high school is nothing 
            like it was just a few years earlier -- and, what's more, they must again confront the 
            teenage terror and anxiety they thought they had left behind.
